<h1>ASP.NET Core - MVC - Movies Tutorial</h1>
<h2>Microsoft Tutorial</h2>

This repo is to keep the source code I created during reading:</br>
ASP.NET Core MVC - Movies Tutorial from Microsoft Learn (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=visual-studio)</br>
As well adding any customization I feel like adding.
